# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** April 2, 2025

Detoxify ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension handles information when you use our service to filter and categorize Twitter/X content.

## Information Collection and Use

### What We Collect

- **Twitter/X Content Metadata:** We analyze tweet text, images, and other publicly available metadata to categorize content.
- **User Preferences:** We store your selected content categories locally on your device.
- **Tweet Preferences:** We store your specific tweet preferences (enforce/diminish) when you select text within tweets.

### What We Don't Collect

We do not collect any of the following information:

- Personal identification information
- Passwords or login credentials
- Browsing history outside of Twitter/X
- Financial information
- Location data
- Communication data
- Health information

## How We Use Information

### Content Classification

We use AI-powered models from Nebius AI Studio to categorize Twitter/X content into specific categories. All classification processing occurs in real-time, analyzing both text and images for comprehensive content understanding.

### User Preferences

Category preferences are stored locally in your browser and are used only to filter content according to your selections.

### Tweet Preferences

Your tweet-specific preferences (text you select to enforce or diminish) are:
- Stored locally in Chrome Storage
- Used to enhance AI filtering decisions
- Limited to 100 recent preferences (older ones are automatically removed)
- Represented with minimal data (timestamps, preference type, sample content)

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage

All user preferences and tweet preferences are stored locally on your device. No user data is transmitted to external servers, and settings persist only within your browser.

### Security

Our extension operates entirely within the Chrome browser environment. We implement standard security practices to protect any locally stored preferences. No authentication or personal data is required or stored.

## Third-Party Access

We do not:

- Sell any user data
- Share information with third parties
- Use data for advertising purposes
- Transfer data for unrelated purposes

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- Choose which content categories to filter
- Select specific tweet content to enforce or diminish
- Toggle visibility of diminished tweets
- Clear your locally stored preferences at any time
- Disable or remove the extension when desired
